# RangeCompacter

It `compact`s ranges into array of arrays.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'range_compacter'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install range_compacter

## Usage

With ranges:

```ruby
item1 = 1..100
item2 = 20..40
item3 = 60..120
item4 = 100..200
compacter = RangeCompacter::Compacter.new(item1, item2, item3, item4)
compacter.compact(30..70) # => [item1, [item2, item3]]
```

With objects responding to `begin`, `end` and `cover?`:

```ruby
class Item
  def initialize(id, range)
    @id = id
    @range = range
  end

  def begin
    @range.begin
  end

  def end
    @range.end
  end

  def cover?(it)
    @range.cover?(it)
  end
end

item1 = Item.new 1, 1..100
item2 = Item.new 2, 20..40
item3 = Item.new 3, 60..120
item4 = Item.new 4, 100..200
compacter = RangeCompacter::Compacter.new(item1, item2, item3, item4)
compacter.compact(30..70) # => [item1, [item2, item3]]
```
